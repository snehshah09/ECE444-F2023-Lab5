What are the pros and cons of TDD? 

Pros:

Improves code quality: TDD encourages writing shorter and testable code. Since tests are written first, they serve as a benchmark for the code to meet, leading to higher-quality code.

Early bug detection: As tests are created before implementation, issues or bugs are detected at an early stage. This helps in fixing problems before they become very expensive and tedious to fix. 

Documentation: The documentation describes how the code should behave and explain how the code is intended to be used. This can be very helpful for new members on the team or if the project is to be extended. 

Cons:

Time-Consuming: TDD sometimes might slow the development cycle as developers need to write tests first and then code. This could be seen as a drawback in some agile frameworks. And sometimes even though it helps eliminate bugs, it is not a guaranteed solution for bug-free code.

Regular maintenance: As the codebase grows, so does the testing. Hence, constantly updating and refactoring the tests can become a significant overhead.
